#summary How to use WorldTracker

= Introduction =

This is a command line utility, that reads a JSON file that you have exported from Google, and plots your locations onto a transparent PNG

The PNG file can be loaded into Google Earth (using the generated KML file), or placed on top of any plate carrÃ©e world image.


= Preparation =
  * You need to have had Google Location History enabled on your phone.
   * On Android phones go to `Settings->Location->Google Location Reporting->Location History`.
   * You can check [https://maps.google.com/locationhistory/b/0/ Google Location History] to see if there is any data.
  * [GetLocationHistoryJSON Download the JSON file] from Google Takeout

= Using the program =
  # Copy the JSON file (should be `LocationHistory.json`) to the same folder as `mytrips.exe`.
  # Open the command line and go to the appropriate directory.
  # Try running `mytrips` without any parameters. It will generate a PNG file called `trips.png`.

== Other options ==
`mytrips.exe [-z <zoom>] [-n <north>] [-s <south>] [-w <west>] [-e <east>] [-x <width>] [-y <height>] [input.json] [output.png]`

= Options to view image =
  * It is helpful to have a map to overlay your PNG file onto.
   * For example, download one of the [http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=74518 NASA images of 5400x2700] resolution.
  * Check if you have software that can paste a transparent PNG over another picture. I use photoshop, and it's just a copy/paste operation.
  * Using Google Earth, you should be able to just open the KML file which should load the PNG image.
