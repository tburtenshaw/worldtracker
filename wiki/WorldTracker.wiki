#summary How to use WorldTracker

= Introduction =

This is a command line utility, that reads a JSON file that you have exported from Google, and plots your locations onto a transparent PNG

The PNG file can be loaded into Google Earth (using the generated KML file), or placed on top of any plate carrÃ©e world image.


= Preparation =
  * You need to have had Google Location History enabled on your phone.
   * On Android phones go to `Settings->Location->Google Location Reporting->Location History`.
   * You can check [https://maps.google.com/locationhistory/b/0/ Google Location History] to see if there is any data.
  * [GetLocationHistoryJSON Download the JSON file] from Google Takeout

= Using the program =
  # Copy the JSON file (should be `LocationHistory.json`) to the same folder as `mytrips.exe`.
  # Open the command line and go to the appropriate directory.
  # Try running `mytrips` without any parameters. It will generate a PNG file called `trips.png` and a KML file `trips.kml` which can be opened with Google Earth.

== Other options ==
`mytrips.exe [<options>] [output.png]`

Common options include:
  * `-{n|s|w|e} <north|south|west|east>` - use these four parameters to set the bounds of the generated overlay. This is a decimal coordinate of the degree latitude or longitude.
  * `-{x|y} <width|height>` - set the width or height in pixels.
  * `[-o] <output.png>` - set the name of the output PNG file. If this is the last or only argument, you can omit the `-o`.
  * `-k <output.kml>` - set the file name of the KML that is exported.
  * `-p <preset>` - loads coordinates from a preset list.


= Options to view image =
  * It is helpful to have a map to overlay your PNG file onto.
   * For example, download one of the [http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=74518 NASA images of 5400x2700] resolution.
  * Check if you have software that can paste a transparent PNG over another picture. I use photoshop, and it's just a copy/paste operation.
  * Using Google Earth, you should be able to just open the KML file which should load the PNG image.
