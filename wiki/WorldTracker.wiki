#summary How to use WorldTracker
#labels usage

= Introduction =

This is a command line utility, that reads a JSON file that you have exported from Google, and plots your locations onto a transparent PNG

The PNG file can be loaded into Google Earth (using the generated KML file), or placed on top of any plate carrée world image.


= Preparation =
  * You need to have had Google Location History enabled on your phone.
   * On Android phones go to `Settings->Location->Google Location Reporting->Location History`.
   * You can check [https://maps.google.com/locationhistory/b/0/ Google Location History] to see if there is any data.
  * [GetLocationHistoryJSON Download the JSON file] from Google Takeout

= Using the program =
  # Copy the JSON file (should be `LocationHistory.json`) to the same folder as `mytrips.exe`.
  # Open the command line and go to the appropriate directory.
  # Try running `mytrips` without any parameters. It will generate a PNG file called `trips.png` and a KML file `trips.kml` which can be opened with Google Earth.

== General use ==
`mytrips.exe [<options>] [output.png]`

== Options ==
  * `-{n|s|w|e} <north|south|west|east>`
   * use these four parameters to set the bounds of the generated overlay. This is a decimal coordinate of the degree latitude or longitude.
  * `-{x|y} <width|height>`
   * Sets the width or height in pixels.
  * `[-o] <output.png>`
   * Sets the name of the output PNG file. If this is the last or only argument, you can omit the `-o`. The KML file will also be based on this file name.
  * `-k <output.kml>`
   * Sets the file name of the KML that is exported, if you want it to be different from the PNG file.
  * `-p <preset>` 
   * Loads coordinates from a preset list. Eventually I want to include all the countries by their internet code. (Try `usa`, `europe`, `asia`, `es`, `in`, `venice`, `scandinaviabaltic`.)
  * `-g <degrees>`
   * Draws a grid `<degrees>` degrees apart.
  * `-c <colorcycle>` 
   * The number of seconds that the plotting colour will cycle through the spectrum. There are some presets (try `-c week` or `-c month`.)
  * `-f <fromtimestamp>`
   * The timestamp in seconds to start plotting from. Anything data earlier than this be ignored.
  * `-t <totimestamp>`
   * The timestamp in seconds to start plotting until. Anything data later than this be ignored.
  * `-z <zoom>`
   * If you leave the coordinates empty, the program will include the entire world. This sets the number of pixels per degree.
  * `-i <input.json>`
   * Use this if you are not using the default filename of `LocationHistory.json`/
== Examples ==
  * `mytrips -n 46 -s 21 -e -70 -west -96 -y 1080 -o test.png -k testout.kml`
   * Generates an overlay within the bounds listed (in this case the eastern United States). The file should be 1080 pixels in height. The output files are `test.png` and `testout.kml`.
  * `mytrips -preset auckland daytrips.png`
   * Creates an overlay centred around Auckland, New Zealand. The generated PNG file will be `daytrips.png` and the KML file `daytrips.kml`.
  * `mytrips -f 1325329200 -t 1356951600 -preset auckland -k auck2012 -o auck2012.png -c day`
   * Shows points in Auckland during the year 2012, the the colour cycling through the spectrum in a day. Output KML file will be `auck2012.kml` even though KML extension omitted.

= Options to view image =
  * It is helpful to have a map to overlay your PNG file onto.
   * For example, download one of the [http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=74518 NASA images of 5400x2700] resolution.
  * Check if you have software that can paste a transparent PNG over another picture. I use photoshop, and it's just a copy/paste operation.
  * Using Google Earth, you should be able to just open the KML file which should load the PNG image.
